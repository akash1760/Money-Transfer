#Intallation

### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Django requireed.

You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

To check if Python is installed, open a terminal and run:
```sh
python --version
```

### Step 2: Install pip
`pip` is the package installer for Python. It usually comes with Python, but you can ensure itâ€™s installed by running:
```sh
pip --version
```

### Step 3: Install Virtualenv
It is a good practice to use virtual environments to manage your project dependencies. Install `virtualenv` using pip:
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:
```sh
cd your_project_directory
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 5: Install Django
With the virtual environment activated, install Django:
```sh
pip install django
```

Verify the installation by running:
```sh
django-admin --version
```

### Step 6: Clone the Git Repository
Use `git clone` to clone the repository. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 7: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the cloned repository's directory:
```sh
cd repository_name
```

### Step 8: Run the Django Development Server
Navigate to the directory containing `manage.py` and run the server:
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your Django application running.
